# YTDL Flow — Product Overview

## What YTDL Flow is

YTDL Flow is a **localhost-only web application** for downloading YouTube audio
and video. It runs entirely on the user's machine: a React web UI, a Node.js
(Express) server, and a Python engine driven by `yt-dlp`. No data leaves the
machine except requests to YouTube itself.

- **Repository:** `nishanth-kkj9/ytdl-flow`
- **Historical name:** previously published as "YTDL Modern"; internal
  identifiers (`ytdl_modern`) are technical names, not branding.

## Purpose

Give users precise control over what they download and how it is produced:
exact format/codec/quality selection, honest verification of the resulting
file, live progress, and persistent history — with security defaults safe
enough to run unattended on a laptop.

## Target users

- Individuals downloading audio/video for personal, offline use.
- Users who care about **exact output format** (codec, container, quality) and
  want the app to *prove* the result matches the request, not just claim it.
- Power users who drive the REST API programmatically alongside the web UI.

## Core media workflow

```
Media discovery
  → format selection
  → queue
  → download
  → processing
  → verification
  → history / status
```

1. **Media discovery (probe):** paste a YouTube URL; the app fetches metadata
   (title, duration, thumbnail, available streams) and guards the request with
   URL allowlisting and a probe watchdog.
2. **Format selection:** audio (MP3, Opus, M4A/AAC, WAV) or video (MP4, WebM,
   MKV) with quality presets; optional trim points (`trim_start`/`trim_end`).
3. **Queue:** jobs queue with a bounded worker pool (5 concurrent downloads),
   cancel/retry support, and live state transitions.
4. **Download:** yt-dlp fetches media using multi-client strategies
   (iOS/Android/web clients) for resilience against bot detection.
5. **Processing:** FFmpeg post-processing (extraction/transcode, trimming),
   metadata + cover-art embedding (title, artist, album, genre, thumbnail).
6. **Verification:** the engine verifies the output codec/container matches the
   selection (Matroska-aware `verify_format`) and reports honest `warnings` on
   the wire; failures produce actionable errors, including a documented
   "no FFmpeg found" state.
7. **History / status:** completed jobs land in persistent history (JSON file
   storage, atomic writes); live progress streams over WebSocket; the REST
   status API exposes the same state for programmatic consumers.

## Major capabilities (as implemented)

- Web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`: probe → confirm → download → live logs →
  history drawer, plus an engine diagnostics panel.
- REST API (`/api/*`) mirroring the UI's capabilities.
- WebSocket one-way broadcast for progress/log/status events.
- Server-persisted download history surviving restarts; job restoration on UI
  mount.
- Format verification with honest warnings; duplicate-title collision retry
  (id-suffixed filename) preventing silent data loss.
- Defense-in-depth localhost security: localhost binding, Host header
  validation, WebSocket origin checks, URL allowlisting, rate limiting, CSP.
- CI: frontend (Vitest/ESLint/tsc), backend (node:test), Python engine
  (pytest/pip-audit), smoke tests.

## Frontend / backend / engine relationship

The **React SPA** owns presentation and local optimistic state. The **Node
server** owns all authority: validation, security, queue, history, and the
engine process lifecycle. The **Python engine** owns media work: yt-dlp
extraction, FFmpeg processing, tagging, verification. Node and Python
communicate over a versioned NDJSON protocol on stdio; the browser talks to
Node only — never to Python or YouTube directly.

## Product direction

- **CURRENT:** everything listed above as implemented.
- **PLANNED:** small documented gaps tracked in `docs/codebase/CONCERNS.md`
  (mount-time job-restore race, ffprobe discovery under `FFMPEG_PATH`-only
  setups, automated CSP header test, server-persisted history thumbnails,
  trim-start-without-trim-end validation, probe watchdog race, remaining low-
  severity polish). See `docs/roadmap.md`.
- **FUTURE:** ideas raised but not committed (engine probe DNS retry,
  README CI badge, further UX polish) — non-binding, listed in
  `docs/roadmap.md` under Ideas.

Only features actually implemented are described as current; anything else in
this file is explicitly labeled planned or future.
